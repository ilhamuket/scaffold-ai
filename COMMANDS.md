# COMMANDS

Canonical command list for this scaffold.

Use this file as the single source of truth for user-facing prompt commands, work-session commands, onboarding commands, pre-coding gate commands, and official workflow step commands.

## How To Use

- Copy one command.
- Replace bracketed placeholders.
- Send it to Codex or Claude as your next instruction.
- For official steps, the runtime must run the pre-step check before executing.
- For implementation, `guardrails/development/PRE_CODING_POLICY.md` must be satisfied and `artifacts/operations/PRE_CODING_GATE.md` must allow the current mode.

## Command Ownership

- User triggers commands by typing them as prompts.
- Codex or Claude interprets the command.
- Skills or agents execute the mapped workflow after required checks and founder confirmation.
- Shell commands, dependency installs, migrations, scaffold execution, and product code edits are blocked unless the pre-coding gate allows them.

## Risk Tiers And Fast Track

- Full detail lives in `AGENTS.md` under "Risk Tiers And Fast Track (Speed Layer)".
- Every request is classified `trivial`, `low`, `medium`, or `major/critical` before any gate applies.
- `trivial`/`low` work (a single bounded, founder-specified change with no schema/security/cross-module impact) skips the compact-plan gate, the feature-slicing template, and the full mandatory-read list — it still needs skill lookup and an open pre-coding gate, and closes with a one-line `SESSION_LOG.md` note instead of the full documentation trio.
- `medium`/`major` work always uses the full gate sequence below — the fast track never applies to it.
- Any surprise mid-task (touches more files, needs a schema/security change, ambiguous behavior) escalates immediately from `trivial`/`low` to `medium`.

## Strict I2 Trigger Rule

- `I2 Impact Scan` is required only when the founder intends to change project behavior, source code, committed configuration, data schema, tests tied to a feature change, UI, API, integrations, refactors, or release behavior.
- `I2 Impact Scan` is not required when the founder only wants to prepare, inspect, or run the application locally through `start dev`.
- `start dev` must not ask the founder to name a module or feature unless a real change is needed.
- Local readiness work may inspect dependencies, `.env.example`, local services, documented setup commands, ports, SDK versions, and existing readiness evidence without `I2`.
- If `start dev` discovers that source code, committed config, dependency definitions, migrations, tests, or feature behavior must be changed, stop and transition to `I2` with the discovered problem as the proposed scope.

## Documentation Closure Rule

- Every `medium` or `major` change must end with documentation sync before the runtime may report the activity complete, paused, handed off, or ready for the next item.
- Minimum required operational sync:
  - `artifacts/operations/WORKFLOW_STATE.md`
  - `artifacts/operations/CURRENT_TASK.md`
  - `artifacts/operations/SESSION_LOG.md`
- Also sync every relevant scope artifact that changed meaningfully, such as bug backlog/log/status, design docs, API specs, release notes, `artifacts/improvement/LEARNINGS.md`, `artifacts/architecture/DECISION_LOG.md`, and memory/feature registry artifacts when applicable.
- If no scope-specific document changed beyond the operational trio, record `no additional documentation delta required` in `artifacts/operations/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- The runtime must not move to the next official step, handoff, or `resume_safe` claim until the latest official step is represented in `artifacts/operations/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- The runtime must not mark a `medium` or `major` activity as `SUCCESS`, `fixed`, `verified`, `closed`, `resume_safe`, or `ready to pr` while documentation sync is still pending.

## Medium/Major Plan-First Gate

- Every `medium` or `major` request must stop before execution, produce a compact plan, and wait for explicit founder approval.
- The compact plan must include objective, scope, intended files or artifact areas, execution steps, verification, documentation sync, and risks.
- Before approval, the runtime must not edit files, run official workflow steps, code, build, refactor, install dependencies, run migrations, scaffold/generate code, close QA, prepare release, or create final handoff.
- Small direct questions and lightweight read-only checks may proceed without a plan when they do not change files, gates, or workflow state.
- If a `medium` or `major` task began without approval, stop, mark the activity `PAUSED`, and repair `artifacts/operations/SESSION_LOG.md` before continuing.

## Coding Skill Lookup Gate

- Before any coding, refactor, test creation, scaffold/code generation, dependency work, migration, or build step, the runtime must search for relevant skills or agents first.
- Codex/GPT must prefer `.codex/skills/` and inspect `.codex/agents/` when an agent role is needed; `.claude/` is fallback reference only when no Codex equivalent exists.
- Claude must prefer `.claude/skills/` and inspect `.claude/agents/` when an agent role is needed; `.codex/` is fallback reference only when no Claude equivalent exists.
- Antigravity must prefer `.agents/skills/` and its `.agents/rules/` entrypoints, then follow `AGENTS.md` and `guardrails/system/ANTIGRAVITY_RUNTIME_POLICY.md`.
- Gemini must follow `AGENTS.md`, use available runtime-compatible skill references, and preserve the same gate and artifact evidence shape.
- If no relevant local skill or agent exists for the coding work, use `find-skills` to discover candidates and validate source reputation, usage, license, and capability fit.
- Auto-download only sources listed in `guardrails/system/SKILL_CHECK_POLICY.md`. Install the complete skill folder into `.codex/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/`, then run `cek skill` before use.
- For a candidate outside the allowlist, present the source and wait for founder approval before downloading.
- If no suitable external skill exists, run the `skill-creator` flow first to create or propose the missing skill before coding proceeds.
- Skill lookup, acquisition, or skill creation does not open implementation permission. The pre-coding gate, allowed write paths, impact scan, plan approval, and founder approval still control execution.

## Dev-Doc Discovery Gate

- Before feature development, bugfix work tied to a feature/module, backend/API change, frontend/UI change, system behavior change, integration, refactor, database change tied to a feature/module, or any related build/coding step, search `dev-doc/` for related documentation first.
- Search exact feature slugs, related module/domain names, reasonable synonyms from the request, and entries from `plan/feature-listing.md` when present.
- If related `dev-doc/` material exists, read relevant BRD, PRD, design, prototype, or notes before planning or building.
- If related `dev-doc/` material is missing, record `dev-doc missing`; for new feature work, do not code until founder interview, requirement synthesis, or planning docs create the needed baseline.
- Dev-doc discovery does not open implementation permission. The pre-coding gate, allowed write paths, impact scan, skill lookup, plan approval, and founder approval still control execution.

## Feature Task Slicing And Context-First Gate

- Before feature planning, implementation planning, coding, refactor, QA closure, release prep, or handoff for a feature/module change, enforce `guardrails/development/FEATURE_TASK_SLICING_POLICY.md`.
- Work on exactly one feature per session unless the founder explicitly approves a wider session.
- Break every feature request into small task slices and select only one slice for the current session.
- For medium/major feature work, use `templates/feature_task_breakdown_template.md`.
- Read active operational state, project context, memory index/ledger, feature registry, related `dev-doc/`, and the latest relevant session log before repository source scanning.
- Do not scan or read the whole repository on every task. Use targeted scans from context, memory, dev-doc, impact scan, route names, symbols, modules, and allowed write paths.
- Full repo scans are allowed only for first `I1`, unknown route/stack, stale or contradicted baseline, high-risk/cross-module/security/migration/release work, documented targeted-scan failure, or explicit founder approval.

## Shared Target Repository Context Gate

- For target repo work under `development/[project-folder]`, enforce `guardrails/development/SHARED_CONTEXT_POLICY.md`.
- Shared developer continuity must live in `development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/` so it can be carried in the target repo Git history.
- Before continuing target repo work, read `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, latest relevant `CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md` entries, and relevant files under `handoffs/`. Also read the root `artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` snapshot plus relevant recent entries.
- If shared context is missing during first target repo intake, create the baseline before handoff or implementation.
- After meaningful work, pause, blocker discovery, QA closure, handoff, implementation slice, or session close, update `PROJECT_STATE.md` when project facts change, update `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, append `CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md` only when contributor-session or handoff detail is needed, and create/update the relevant shared handoff file. Append the required event to root `artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
- Shared context must be Git-safe and must not contain secrets, `.env` values, raw chat transcripts, credential dumps, private personal data, or large raw logs.

## Code-Derived Baseline Gate

- During first `I1 Existing Project Intake`, enforce `guardrails/development/CODE_DERIVED_BASELINE_POLICY.md` when targeted documentation discovery finds no usable project documentation.
- Ask the founder whether documents, links, diagrams, access to another repository, or other context exists only after the targeted documentation search finds no relevant material.
- If no material exists, create `development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/PROJECT_STATE.md` from `templates/shared_project_state_template.md`, then synchronize verified stable facts into scaffold memory and the feature registry.
- Use manifest, configuration, entrypoint, route/API, schema, test, and targeted module evidence before expanding repository scans. Record unknowns instead of guessing.

## Requirement Precedence And Conflict Gate

- Before planning or coding behavior changes, enforce `guardrails/development/REQUIREMENT_PRECEDENCE_POLICY.md`.
- Record the controlling requirement source in the implementation plan after reading relevant founder decisions, PRD, BRD, flows, API/schema constraints, design, security, QA, and current behavior in precedence order.
- When relevant requirement sources conflict or important ambiguity remains, create `dev-doc/[feature-name]/requirement-conflicts/[conflict-id].md` from `templates/requirement_conflict_decision_template.md`.
- Do not code while an unresolved conflict affects scope, acceptance criteria, API/data behavior, security, user flow, or allowed write paths.

## Session Commands

### Start (Automatic Project Route)
```text
start
```

Expected behavior:
- Inspect `development/` with hidden entries included, excluding only scaffold-owned `_project-template/`, before asking for a project target.
- If it has zero target-project folders, select `greenfield_project`, report that a new-project discovery is required, and ask for project name, intended outcome, first feature candidate, constraints, and available references. Do not create a framework, install dependencies, or write product code.
- If it has one or more target-project folders, treat the request as existing/inherited-project work, list detected project folders, and continue through the project picker and `I1 Existing Project Intake` route.
- Whenever one target project becomes active--after selection through `start`/`start dev`, attach, or a resumed session--inspect its local Graphify status. When it is missing or stale, explain that a knowledge graph maps code, docs, configuration, and project artifacts so an agent can understand architecture, trace impact, and resume work accurately. For a missing graph, offer Graphify setup; if `uv` is also missing, explain it is a local prerequisite and ask separately before installing it. Ask `Set up, build, or refresh the knowledge graph now? (Y/N)` and proceed only after `Y`.
- Do not scan all target projects automatically. A graph is always local to one selected project and `graphify-out/` is ignored by Git.
- A master pull never upgrades Graphify in a target project. Report the installed version and offer an explicit, project-scoped update only when the user approves; rebuild the graph and synchronize shared context after an approved upgrade.
- Follow `guardrails/development/GREENFIELD_PROJECT_POLICY.md` for the zero-entry route. `start` does not open a build gate.

### Start Work Session
```text
start work
```

Equivalent aliases:
```text
mulai bekerja
begin work
work
```

Expected behavior:
- Apply the same automatic route as `start`: zero target-project folders starts Greenfield Discovery; one or more target-project folders list detected project folders with numbered choices.
- For the existing/inherited route only, ask the founder to continue by replying with the project number; if the founder already supplied a project path, skip the picker and use that target directly.
- For the greenfield route, ask for the project brief instead of a project number.
- After route selection, read current workflow state.
- Show the selected project, workflow position, active gate, safest next step, and top recommendations.
- Show the command menu from this file.
- Do not execute official steps without confirmation.

### Start Dev
```text
start dev
```

Equivalent aliases:
```text
dev
mulai dev
```

Expected behavior:
- Use the selected project from the active `work` session, or ask for a project target if none is active.
- Treat this command as local development readiness, not feature implementation.
- Do not require `I2 Impact Scan` for local readiness when no project behavior change is requested.
- Read the current workflow state, active gate, pre-coding gate, and any relevant environment-readiness artifact.
- Report whether the project is ready to be developed and run locally.
- If blocked, list the exact missing approvals, missing local setup steps, blocked write areas, and safest next action.
- If local setup is only partially complete, separate `already ready`, `still missing`, and `not yet approved`.
- Do not start feature implementation from this command.
- Do not run dependency installs, migrations, or boot commands unless the gate already allows that scope and the founder confirms.
- If local readiness requires source/config/dependency/schema/test/behavior changes, stop and recommend `I2 Impact Scan` for that discovered change.

### Improve Process
```text
improve
```

Expected behavior:
- Review scaffold rules, docs, workflows, runtime compatibility, and project structure.
- Propose a safe improvement plan first.
- Do not edit files until the founder approves the plan.

### Propose Core Flow Change
```text
propose core flow change
```
Expected behavior:
- Read `guardrails/system/SCAFFOLD_CORE_CHANGE_POLICY.md`.
- Explain why a project-specific extension is insufficient.
- Identify affected protected paths, gates, templates, runtime behavior, and validation.
- Present a compact plan and require founder or CODEOWNERS approval before implementation or merge.

### Improve Skill
```text
improve skill
```

Expected behavior:
- Review the named or relevant skill.
- Propose targeted skill improvements first.
- Do not edit skills until the founder approves the plan.

### Check Skill Catalog
```text
cek skill
```

Equivalent aliases:
```text
check skill
```

Expected behavior:
- Read `guardrails/system/SKILL_CHECK_POLICY.md`.
- Scan `.codex/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`.
- Normalize any new skill folder that is missing the required `category__` prefix.
- Copy missing skill folders so both runtime directories end with the same skill list.
- Refresh `guardrails/system/SKILL_CATALOG.md`.
- Report shared skills, copied folders, and any parity failure.
- Do not edit product code.

### Find Or Acquire A Skill
```text
find skill for: [capability]
```
Expected behavior:
- Search existing `.codex/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` first.
- When no local match exists, use `find-skills` to search external candidates.
- Validate source reputation, usage, license, skill contents, and capability fit before any download.
- Auto-acquire only allowlisted publishers from `guardrails/system/SKILL_CHECK_POLICY.md`; otherwise wait for founder approval.
- Install approved skills as complete, normalized folders in `.codex/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/`, then run `cek skill` to verify runtime synchronization and refresh the catalog.
- If no suitable skill is available, invoke `skill-creator` before coding proceeds.

## AI Contributor Lifecycle Commands

These commands use `workflows/ai_contributor_lifecycle.md` and the matching templates in `templates/`.

### Attach Repo
```text
attach repo
```
Expected behavior:
- Record or inspect the target repository path/URL, branch, commit, remote, and working tree state.
- Do not install dependencies, run migrations, scaffold, or edit product code.
- Continue into `I1 Existing Project Intake` when the target repository is available.

### Readiness Baseline
```text
readiness baseline
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/readiness_baseline_template.md`.
- Capture dependency, env, database, migration, seed, local run, route/healthcheck, build, lint/typecheck, test, formatter, CI/CD, known issue, and blocker status.
- Record CI/CD and formatter discovery, baseline failure classification, and whether the project is safe for the approved scoped development work.
- For an existing project, a completed readiness baseline is mandatory pre-coding evidence; known baseline failures may remain only when they are documented, scoped away from the requested change, and explicitly accepted in the gate evidence.
- Treat this as local readiness evidence; do not start feature implementation.

### Implementation Plan
```text
implementation plan
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/implementation_plan_template.md`.
- Record the controlling requirement source and every active requirement-conflict decision artifact.
- Require completed intake and impact scan for the scoped change.
- Record scope, non-scope, allowed write paths, blocked paths, technical plan, QA plan, rollback notes, founder approval reference, and the matching plan-approval checklist artifact path.
- Before any build/coding step, create or update `artifacts/operations/plan-approval-checklists/[task-id]-[context-name]-plan-approval.md` from `templates/plan_approval_checklist_template.md`.
- Do not edit product code.

### During Dev QA
```text
during dev qa
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/during_dev_qa_log_template.md`.
- Record incremental checks after meaningful implementation changes.
- Separate confirmed issues, fixed issues, deferred issues, and the last passing point.
- Use the impact scan and selected task slice to run the smallest relevant check first. Do not repeat unchanged checks after the last passing point.
- Summarize command results and store large raw output under the approved QA artifact path instead of copying it into operational logs or chat.
- Do not broaden to a full suite without recording an allowed reason from `guardrails/qa/QA_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_POLICY.md`.
- If the current change is `medium` or `major`, the session log entry for the latest step must be written in the same documentation-sync batch before the next step starts.
- For `medium` or `major` changes, do not close the activity until the required operational and scope-document sync is also recorded.

### Self Review
```text
self review
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/self_review_template.md`.
- Check scope, acceptance criteria, secrets, debug logs, naming, validation, error handling, dependencies, and breaking-change risk before `R1`.

### Final QA Evidence
```text
final qa evidence
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/granular_qa_evidence_template.md`.
- Enforce `guardrails/qa/QA_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_POLICY.md`: define QA scope from impact evidence, run targeted checks by default, and record any allowed reason for a broad/full suite.
- Record the delta since `last_passing_point`, concise command summaries, and durable evidence paths for large output.
- Record unit, integration, E2E/browser, UI/visual, security, performance, and regression status as `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, or `skipped`.
- If any QA layer is skipped, record the reason and whether founder approval or baseline evidence exists.
- If UI, layout, responsive behavior, visual state, animation, chart, canvas, generated image, PDF/rendered document, or browser-visible flow needs human judgment, notify the founder that manual visual QA is required.
- Manual visual QA notification must list reason, impacted page/route/state, local URL or screenshot evidence when available, approval checklist, and current blocker/risk status.
- Do not mark `ui_visual` as `pass` until automated evidence is sufficient or founder manual visual approval is recorded.
- Do not claim final QA has passed until required QA layers for the current task type have evidence.
- Write evidence to `artifacts/test/[feature]-qa-evidence.md`.
- This runs before `final impact check` and `ready to pr` for behavior, source, API, database, UI, security, performance, or release-affecting changes.

### Final Impact Check
```text
final impact check
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/final_impact_check_template.md`.
- Check final impact against requirement, scope, code, API, database, UI, user flow, security, performance, deployment, documentation, and backward compatibility.
- Read `artifacts/test/[feature]-qa-evidence.md` when it exists or is required by the task type.
- Fail the check if a `medium` or `major` activity changed behavior/evidence but the related operational or scope documentation was not updated.

### Ready To PR
```text
ready to pr
```
Expected behavior:
- Use `templates/pr_readiness_template.md`.
- Confirm requirement, code scope, tests, regression, final impact, known issues, reviewer notes, and suggested PR summary.
- Confirm documentation sync is complete for any `medium` or `major` work, including `WORKFLOW_STATE`, `CURRENT_TASK`, `SESSION_LOG`, and every relevant scope artifact.
- Confirm the latest official step has a matching session log entry before PR-readiness is accepted.
- This prepares PR readiness evidence; it does not create a remote pull request.

### Handoff
```text
handoff
```
Expected behavior:
- Read the active task, workflow state, latest session log, shared target context, and relevant memory.
- Confirm the current feature and selected task slice.
- Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` when project facts changed, `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md` when detailed contributor/handoff context is needed, and the relevant handoff file under `development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/handoffs/`. Append the required event to root `artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md`.
- Record completed work, remaining work, decisions, changed files, commands and test results, known issues, blockers, Do Not Repeat notes, and the exact next step.
- Do not claim `resume_safe` for medium/major work until the latest official step and required documentation sync are recorded.
- This prepares continuity for another developer or runtime; it does not close QA or approve release.

### Release Readiness
```text
release readiness
```
Expected behavior:
- Treat this as an explicit founder-requested or founder-approved official step.
- Use the release readiness or PR readiness templates in `templates/` as applicable.
- Confirm scope summary, test summary, rollback path, smoke checklist, configuration checklist, backward compatibility, user/data impact, final QA evidence, final impact check, known issues, and release blockers.
- Confirm the latest official step has a matching `SESSION_LOG.md` entry and all required operational and scope documentation is synchronized.
- Distinguish `ready to pr` (review readiness) from `release readiness` (release consideration) and `release` (actual deployment or publication).
- Do not perform deployment, publication, migration, or production action from this command without a separate explicit founder release decision.

### Release
```text
release
```
Expected behavior:
- Require completed release readiness evidence and explicit founder release approval.
- Re-check the approved scope, environment, configuration, smoke checklist, rollback path, and known risks immediately before execution.
- Execute only the approved release action and update release, QA, operational, and shared-context artifacts.
- Stop if release evidence is incomplete, test status is unknown, a blocker is unresolved, or the requested action exceeds the approved scope.

### Feature Listing
```text
feature listing
```
Equivalent aliases:
```text
process feature listing
cek feature listing
```
Expected behavior:
- Read `plan/feature-listing.md`.
- Ignore blank lines and lines beginning with `#`.
- Accept only `new feature/[feature-name]` and `add feature/[feature-name]`.
- Process one feature at a time; do not activate multiple feature entries in the same session unless the founder explicitly approves it.
- For each accepted feature, check required docs in `dev-doc/[feature-name]/`.
- For each accepted feature, check design references in `dev-doc/[feature-name]/design/`.
- Do not look for active feature BRD or PRD in removed legacy roots; use `dev-doc/[feature-name]/brd.md` and `dev-doc/[feature-name]/prd.md`.
- Mark missing docs or design as `missing`; do not invent content.
- Break the selected feature into task slices and choose one slice for the current session.
- For `add feature/[feature-name]`, require impact scan before coding.
- Report recommended next action without opening build gates.

Selection behavior:
- `start`: inspect `development/`; zero entries selects Greenfield Discovery, while one or more entries opens the existing-project picker.
- `work` / `start work`: apply the same route as `start`; use the project picker only when `development/` has one or more entries.
- `1-17`: run the mapped pre-step check before any step work.
- `18`: read `artifacts/operations/WORKFLOW_STATE.md`, `artifacts/operations/CURRENT_PHASE.md`, and `artifacts/operations/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- `19`: read `artifacts/improvement/LEARNINGS.md` and `artifacts/architecture/DECISION_LOG.md`.

- `24`: use memory-curator to capture, sync, prune, or review memory according to the supplied source and scope.
- `25`: use memory-curator in read-only mode; read `artifacts/memory/FEATURE_REGISTRY.md` and `artifacts/memory/FEATURE_REGISTRY.toml`.
- `26`: read `guardrails/flutter/FLUTTER_DEVELOPMENT_POLICY.md` and `artifacts/flutter/FLUTTER_INTAKE_CHECKLIST.md`; do not edit product code.
- `27`: use flutter-builder only after the pre-coding gate is open and allowed write paths exist.
- `28`: use flutter-qa for approved Flutter analyzer/test/smoke scope.
- `29`: treat this as local development readiness for the selected project; inspect gate status, local setup evidence, allowed write paths, and remaining blockers before any real execution.
- `30`: run the skill check policy against `.codex/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`; refresh `guardrails/system/SKILL_CATALOG.md`; do not edit product code.
- `31-39`: run the AI Contributor Lifecycle support command using `workflows/ai_contributor_lifecycle.md`; write scaffold evidence only and respect the pre-coding gate.
- `40`: read `guardrails/development/SHARED_CONTEXT_POLICY.md`, then read target repo `artifacts/shared/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md`, relevant `handoffs/`, and root `artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` snapshot/relevant entries.
- `41`: update target repo `artifacts/shared/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, append `CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md` only for detailed contributor/handoff context, create/update the relevant shared handoff from templates, and append required root `AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md` event.
- `0`: summarize current session and stop.

```text
Review this existing project and scope only this change:
[feature or module name]
Start with intake and impact scan before planning implementation.
```

### Check Bug Listing
```text
cek bug listing

Read the active root bug listing from:
bug-listing/list-bug.md

If a module is specified, read:
bug-listing/[bug-list-name].md

Bug list names are dynamic. They may be scoped by module, page, role, flow, sprint, release, or regression batch.
Summarize open bugs, missing required fields, severity/status distribution, and the safest next bug-fix scope.
Do not edit product code.
```

### Work From Bug Listing
```text
kerjakan bug backlog

Use the active root bug listing:
bug-listing/list-bug.md

For named bug-list work, use:
bug-listing/[bug-list-name].md

Before coding:
- run or verify intake and impact scan for the selected bug scope
- confirm allowed write paths
- confirm pre-coding gate
- preserve stable bug IDs

After fixing:
- update the root bug listing
- update artifacts/test/[module]-bug-log.md
- update artifacts/test/[module]-bug-status.md
- run required QA, including Playwright for UI/browser-visible bugfixes
```

### Create Bug Listing
```text
Create a root bug listing for module:
[bug-list-name]

Use:
bug-listing/bug-list-template.md

Create or update:
bug-listing/[bug-list-name].md

Use kebab-case names scoped by module, page, role, flow, sprint, release, or regression batch.
Do not create founder-facing bug lists under artifacts/test/bug-list/.
```

[module or subsystem]
```

## Intake And Audit

### Existing Project Intake
```text
Run existing-project intake.
Identify:
- current stack
- frontend/backend roots
- test stack
- major modules
- inherited constraints
- usable project documentation first
- if no relevant documentation exists, ask the founder for references before creating a code-derived `artifacts/shared/PROJECT_STATE.md` baseline
- record source-linked facts, unknowns, and targeted future scan paths; sync verified stable facts to memory
```

### Impact Scan
```text
Run impact scan for this change:
[feature, bugfix, redesign, revamp, flow change, refactor, migration, or module]
List impacted pages, endpoints, modules, docs, tests, allowed write paths, blocked paths, and risks.
Do not edit product code yet.
```

Use `I2 Impact Scan` for requested changes only. Do not use it merely to run or prepare a project locally; use `start dev` for that.

### Architecture And Stack Audit
```text
Audit the current architecture and stack of this existing project.
Do not propose replacements yet.
Show the current system map first.
```

## Planning Phase

```
Require final QA evidence, final impact check, documentation sync, and explicit founder release decision before any actual deployment or publication.

## Framework And Scaffold

### Confirm Existing Stack
```text
Review the current framework stack and tell me whether it should remain unchanged.
Do not scaffold a replacement unless the current stack is clearly blocking the project.
```

### Framework Change Assessment
```text
Assess whether this existing project should keep or replace its framework stack.
Show tradeoffs first.
Do not execute scaffold changes yet.
```

### Playwright Setup
```text
Set up Playwright for this existing project without polluting the repo root.
Keep all Playwright runtime files under the playwright/ folder.
Respect the current frontend route.
```

## Design Workflow

### Use General Design References
```text
Use the design references in:
templates/design/master-ui-templates/
Then map the relevant patterns into the impacted feature design folder.
```

### Use Figma Reference
```text
Use the Figma reference from:
dev-doc/[feature-name]/design/[page]/[section]/figma-link.txt
Then update only the affected design specs.
```

### Use Uploaded Design Images
```text

dev-doc/[feature-name]/design/[page]/[section]/assets/
Then complete the design specs for that area only.
```

### Use HTML UI Prototype
```text
Use the HTML UI prototype reference from:
dev-doc/[feature-name]/design/[page]/[section]/[sub-section]/prototype/index.html
Treat it as a UI/UX guide only. Do not copy it into production source code unless the approved development scope explicitly says to implement it.
```

## Review And Improvement

### Improve This Existing Project Process
```text
Improve this existing-project scaffold.
Review the runtime rules, onboarding flow, and incremental workflow first.
Do not apply changes yet.
Show me a safe improvement plan.
```

### Improve A Skill
```text
Improve this skill:
[skill name]
Review current project needs and existing-project workflow fit first.
Do not change the skill yet.
Show me the proposed improvement plan.
```

## Good Prompt Patterns

### Limit Scope
```text
Scope this to one feature, module, or fix only:
[scope name]
```

### Preserve Current Conventions
```text
Preserve the current project conventions unless there is an approved decision to change them.
```

### Allow Approved Large Change
```text
This change may include redesign, revamp, flow change, or refactor.
Keep it scoped, impact-scanned, and rollout-safe.
```

### Keep It Short
```text
Keep the output concise and implementation-ready.
```

### Block Real Execution
```text
Dry-run only.
Do not execute real scaffold or destructive changes.
```

### Use Existing Artifacts
```text
Use the existing docs, code patterns, and artifacts in the repository instead of recreating them.
```

### Read Shared Target Context
```text
Read shared target repository context before continuing:
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/handoffs/
Then continue with targeted scans only.
```

### Update Shared Target Context
```text
Update shared target repository context for this work session:
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md
artifacts/operations/AGENT_ACTIVITY_LOG.md
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/CONTRIBUTOR_LOG.md
development/[project-folder]/artifacts/shared/handoffs/[feature]-[slice]-handoff.md
Keep it Git-safe and do not store secrets, raw chat, or large logs.
```

### Slice Feature First
```text
Analyze this feature into small task slices first.
Select only one slice for this session.
Use context, memory, feature registry, and dev-doc before scanning source code.
Do not scan the whole repository unless an allowed reason is documented.
```

## Suggested First Commands

For scaffold maintenance, contributors must create a branch and Pull Request. Only `@odonplay` may update `main`; see `docs/REPOSITORY_GOVERNANCE.md`.

### Codex Model Route

```text
Route this new Codex session by task complexity, accuracy floor, risk, and token efficiency.
Use scripts/codex-route.ps1 in dry-run mode first.
Record only Git-safe routing evidence in the target project's artifacts/shared/AI_ROUTING_LOG.md.
Do not launch or change implementation gates.
```

Windows example:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\codex-route.ps1 --dry-run "Perbaiki bug login yang terisolasi"
```

Documented escalation example:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\codex-route.ps1 --dry-run --escalate-from standard --escalation-evidence artifacts\test\login-bug-log.md "Investigate repeated login failure"
```

Add `--launch` only after model availability is confirmed and the normal scaffold gates permit the requested work.

For normal agent work, do not ask the founder to select a model. The Terra routing supervisor runs the route automatically. `--auto-delegate --launch` is reserved for the supervisor: Terra continues standard work and creates one ephemeral Luna/Sol worker only when required.

Profiles: Luna/`fast` for clear low-risk work, Terra/`standard` for daily development, Sol/`deep` for complex work, and Sol/`critical` for critical risk. GPT-5.5 requires explicit `--legacy-5-5`; it is never a fallback. A documented escalation uses `--escalate-from fast|standard --escalation-evidence [artifact-path]`.

### Claude Code VS Code Model Route

```text
For this Claude Code VS Code task, classify L0-L4 using the Claude VS Code routing policy.
Do not ask me to select a model.
Use a bounded native Haiku subagent only for L0, keep Sonnet for L1-L2, and use an Opus subagent only for bounded L3 analysis or independent review.
For L4, verify a configured Fable-compatible model ID or alias first. If it is unavailable, record model_switch_unavailable truthfully.
Do not claim that VS Code Auto permission mode changes the model or that the visible session model was switched in place.
Do not bypass any scaffold gate.
```

Validate the repository configuration with `./scripts/check-claude-routing.ps1` on Windows or `./scripts/check-claude-routing.sh` on Unix-like shells. See `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_VSCODE_SETUP.md` for the extension boundary and setup.

```text
Review the current scaffold state.
Read artifacts/operations/WORKFLOW_STATE.md, artifacts/operations/CURRENT_PHASE.md, artifacts/operations/CURRENT_TASK.md, guardrails/development/PRE_CODING_POLICY.md, and artifacts/operations/PRE_CODING_GATE.md.
Tell me the safest next action.
Do not edit files.
```

```text
Read SCAFFOLD_WORKFLOW.md for the concise end-to-end developer workflow.
Then tell me the safest next action based on the current operational state.
Do not edit files.
```

```text
Run I1 Existing Project Intake for:
development/[project-folder]

Mode: read_only_audit.
Do not edit product code.
Update scaffold docs only.
```

```text
Run impact scan for this change:
[scope]
List impacted pages, endpoints, modules, docs, tests, allowed write paths, blocked paths, and risks.
Do not edit product code yet.
```
